=====================================
AI bonus
=====================================

The AI engine is based on dictionary which evaluate each move
by giving each move a score
if the score is high ,it means that the move is good

=====================================
Criteria AI 1
=====================================
The evaluation is based on couple characteristics
1)counts the possible 4 in a next move point :
Assume 1:
"1" to Move
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
- 0 0 0 0 0
The - point has 3 possible winning : slant column and row

Assume 2:
"2" to Move
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
- 0 1 0 0 0
In this position player "2" in the - point
has only 2 possible winning options that why
Assume 1 > Assume 2
meaning assume 1 has better score in this regard

Assume 3:
"2" to Move
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 - 0 0 0
move -> - has 3 possible wins in rows
also 1 in slant
and 1 in column
that's why he'll receive 5 points
and that's why ->     Assume 3 > Assume 2 > Assume 1

=====================================
Criteria AI 2
=====================================
I did the exact same thing as "Criteria AI 1"
with a new change it gives an evaluation for 3 instead of 4

=====================================
Criteria AI 3
=====================================
If player moves and this move make the opponent winning in 1 move
Than the computer really hate this move


=====================================
No GUI
=====================================

    Game Play Interface:
    In order to play the game with no GUI
    you should use the following commands
    make_move(num_of_column int)
    get_current_player()
    get_player_at(x int, y int)

    Easy sample No GUI:
        g = Game()
        g.make_move(0)

        # This simple function checks who needs to play
        if g.get_current_player() == Game.WHITE:
            print("It's White turn to play")
        if g.get_current_player() == Game.BLACK:
            print("It's Black turn to play")
        #

        g.make_move(1)
        g.make_move(0)
        g.make_move(1)
        g.make_move(0)


        if g.get_player_at(1, 0) == Game.WHITE:
            print("White is occupying (1,0) point")
        if g.get_player_at(1, 0) == Game.BLACK:
            print("Black is occupying (1,0) point")
        if g.get_player_at(0, 0) is None:
            print("no body is occupying (1,0) point")


        # Prints the board
        print(g.board)
        #
