No GUI:
    Game Play Interface:
    In order to play the game with no GUI
    you should use the following commands
    make_move(num_of_column int)
    get_current_player()
    get_player_at(x int, y int)

    Easy sample No GUI:
        g = Game()
        g.make_move(0)

        # This simple function checks who needs to play
        if g.get_current_player() == Game.WHITE:
            print("It's White turn to play")
        if g.get_current_player() == Game.BLACK:
            print("It's Black turn to play")
        #

        g.make_move(1)
        g.make_move(0)
        g.make_move(1)
        g.make_move(0)


        if g.get_player_at(1, 0) == Game.WHITE:
            print("White is occupying (1,0) point")
        if g.get_player_at(1, 0) == Game.BLACK:
            print("Black is occupying (1,0) point")
        if g.get_player_at(0, 0) is None:
            print("no body is occupying (1,0) point")


        # Prints the board
        print(g.board)
        #
